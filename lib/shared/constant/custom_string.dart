  static String soilPreparation = '''
Prepare the paddy field by plowing and leveling the soil to create a smooth and uniform surface. Remove any debris or weeds that may interfere with seedling growth.
''';

  static String seedSelection = '''
Begin by selecting high-quality paddy seeds suitable for your growing conditions. Choose varieties that are well-suited to your climate, soil type, and water availability.
Before selecting high-quality paddy seeds suitable for your growing conditions, begin by selecting your desired planting area within the application. Choose varieties that are well-suited to your selected climate, soil type, and water availability.
''';

  static String seedPreparation = '''
Pre-germinate the seeds by soaking them in water for 24-48 hours before planting. This helps to promote uniform germination and early seedling establishment.
''';

  static String irrigation = '''
After transplanting, ensure the paddy field is adequately flooded with water to cover the seedlings. Maintain a shallow layer of water (around 5-10 cm) throughout the crop's growth period. Periodically check soil moisture levels and adjust irrigation as needed to prevent waterlogging or drought stress.
''';

  static String soilTemperatureMonitoring = '''
Utilize our application's soil temperature monitoring feature to track the temperature of the soil throughout the growing season.
The application collects real-time data from sensors installed in the field to provide accurate soil temperature readings.
Monitoring soil temperature is essential for determining optimal planting times, assessing crop growth conditions, and managing irrigation practices.
''';

  static String fertilizing = '''
Fertilize according to soil test recommendations and crop nutrient requirements. Apply evenly across the field or directly around plant bases. Incorporate into soil through light tilling or watering. Our app offers four fertilization phases, allowing users to track activities and meet crop nutrient needs at each growth stage.
''';

  static String monitoringPaddy = '''
While applying fertilizers, you can simultaneously monitor your paddy fields using our application. Through real-time monitoring, our platform detects potential issues such as diseases, nutrient deficiencies, and stressors, empowering you to take timely corrective actions and optimize crop yield.
''';

  static String pestDiseaseManagement = '''
While surveying your paddy field for signs of pests and diseases, our application aids you by leveraging IoT technology integrated with a machine learning algorithm. This innovative system identifies pest types and their precise locations using GPS data, enabling you to effectively implement integrated pest management (IPM) practices for pest control. Additionally, you can conveniently monitor the types of pests detected through this app's user-friendly interface.
''';

  static String harvesting = '''
Assess the readiness of the paddy crop for harvest when the majority of the grains have turned golden yellow and the moisture content is around 20-25%. Use appropriate harvesting equipment, such as sickles or combine harvesters, to cut the paddy stalks close to the ground. Gather the harvested paddy into bundles or piles for transportation to the drying facility.
